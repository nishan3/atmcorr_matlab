This code runs http://atmcorr.gsfc.nasa.gov/atm_corr.html that uses 
input parameters and uses the National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction (NCEP)
modeled atmospheric global profiles for a particular date, time
and location as input. Using commercially-available MODTRAN
software and a suite of integration algorithm to compute site-specific
atmospheric transmission, and upwelling and downwelling
radiances


to run a loop.
It's really annoying to run the website and manually input the 
parameters.
A loop calling this function will sove this issue
% 1) Have input variables in a table/mat
% 2) create loop and save outputs in table/mat
% 3) use different email in every step (repeat after 3rd or 4th loop) to
% avoid possible problems
